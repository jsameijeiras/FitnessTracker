The error you're encountering during deployment on Render—`[tool.poetry] section not found in pyproject.toml`—indicates that Render is attempting to use Poetry for dependency management because it detects a `pyproject.toml` file. However, this file lacks the necessary `[tool.poetry]` section, leading to the failure.

**Cause:**

Render's build system automatically uses Poetry when a `pyproject.toml` file is present. If this file doesn't contain the `[tool.poetry]` section, Poetry cannot proceed, resulting in the error. This behavior is consistent with Poetry's expectations, as it requires specific configurations within `pyproject.toml` to function correctly citeturn0search2.

**Resolution:**

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

1. **Configure `pyproject.toml` for Poetry:**

   If you intend to use Poetry, ensure that your `pyproject.toml` includes the necessary `[tool.poetry]` section. This section should define your project's metadata and dependencies. A minimal example:

   ```toml
   [tool.poetry]
   name = "fitness-tracker"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "A simple fitness tracking app"
   authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

   [tool.poetry.dependencies]
   python = "^3.11"
   flask = "^2.0"
   gunicorn = "^20.0"

   [build-system]
   requires = ["poetry-core"]
   build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
   ```


   Ensure that this file is committed to your repository so that Render can access it during the build process.

2. **Remove `pyproject.toml` and Use `requirements.txt`:**

   If you prefer not to use Poetry, you can remove the `pyproject.toml` file and instead use a `requirements.txt` file to specify your dependencies. This approach aligns with traditional Python dependency management and is compatible with Render's build system. Create a `requirements.txt` file listing your dependencies:

   ```
   flask
   gunicorn
   ```


   Then, in Render's build settings, set the build command to `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the start command to `gunicorn app:app`, replacing `app:app` with the appropriate module and application name if different.

**Recommendation:**

For simplicity and to align with Render's default behavior, using a `requirements.txt` file is often the more straightforward approach unless you have specific reasons to use Poetry.
